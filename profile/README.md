## Character Traits

### 1. Cryptic Communication

   ● Mr. Crawling doesn’t use conventional language; instead, his dialogue might be composed of riddles, pictograms, or a symbolic cipher that players must decode to understand his intentions.

   ● His speech patterns could shift unpredictably, incorporating elements like palindromes, anagrams, or non-linear syntax.

### 2. Eerie Presence:

   ● Physically, Mr. Crawling might have an unsettling or otherworldly appearance, such as elongated limbs, unnatural movements, or glowing eyes that hint at a hidden power or knowledge.

   ● His movements might reflect his name—perhaps he literally crawls or shifts unnervingly, adding tension to his encounters.

### 3. Moral Ambiguity:

   ● He isn’t inherently good or evil, acting as a guide or an obstacle depending on how the protagonist interacts with him. This ambiguity forces players to weigh their decisions carefully when dealing with him.

### 4. Interactive Mechanics:

  ● Players may need to interact with him using in-game tools like a cipher wheel, a decoder book, or by solving environmental puzzles linked to his behavior.
